==========
This simple project aims to simplify the start of an ignite server instance, moving all the configuration inside a 
java class, [specifically this one](https://github.com/vidaniello/ignite-server-starter/blob/main/src/main/java/com/github/vidaniello/igniteserver/IgniteNode.java), in addition it exposes a series of commands to restart, stop and query the service, 
both from the line of command (unix or windows) or from a web browser.
